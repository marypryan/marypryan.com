    Before I could start building a website, I spent a lot of time learning from Youtube and HTML/CSS related texts<id="emoji">üìö When I felt I had enough to start, I forged ahead knowing I had minimal knowledge. All of what you see on this webpage is what I have learned. In the "resource" tab, you will see all of the materials I have used.

    First I had to buy a domain for my host, I used a simple google search and found a domain to purchase<id="emoji">üíµ I used this link to buy one<id="emoji">‚û°Ô∏è<a href="https://domains.google"target="_blank"><cite>Google Domains</cite></a> Next I located a host called GitHub which was another learning experience. After that,I had to connect my domain (marypryan.com) to my host. Afterwards I started to make edits, commits through GitHub until I discovered Visual Studio Code(VSC) which is essentially a fast source code editor. After connecting my VSC with my GitHub and then downloading these applications to my desktop I was able to be more effective and efficient in my coding. 
    Some challenges that I encountered was my "parent" folder:My folder was to be a replica of my host which had corresponded with my VSC. For some reason I was not seeing any changes. I realized that I had a duplicate copy "child folder?" of my "parent" folder stored on my desktop. I then had to access my GitHub folder <stong>only</strong>using <em>"Finder"</em> to minimize repeat of ineffective codes. Another set back was not being meticulous of texts in coding which showed after making several "committs". Which is why I used "Tryit Editor V3.6"( in resource page) Overall, debugging was my hardest challenge, my  goal is to train myself  to plan more systematically. ..
