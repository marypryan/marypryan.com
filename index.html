    Before I could start building a website, I spent a lot of time learning from Youtube and HTML/CSS related texts<id="emoji">üìö When I felt I had enough material to start with, I forged ahead despite not having a solid foundation in a language of code. All of what you see and read  on this webpage is what I have learned. In the "resource" tab, you will see all of the materials I have used.

    First I had to buy a domain for my host. I used a google search and learned that I had to purchase a  domain <id="emoji">üíµ I used this link to buy one<id="emoji">‚û°Ô∏è<a href="https://domains.google"target="_blank"><cite>Google Domains</cite></a> Next I located a host called GitHub which was another learning experience. After that,I had to connect my domain (marypryan.com) to my host. Afterwards I started to make edits and commits through GitHub until I discovered Visual Studio Code(VSC) which is essentially a fast source code editor. After connecting my VSC with my GitHub and then downloading these applications to my desktop I was able to be more effective and efficient in my coding. 
      I also learned to <stong>only</strong>use <em>"Finder"</em> when locating my "parent"folder. Debugging was my hardest challenge,Which is why I used "Tryit Editor V3.6". Overall, my  goal is to train myself to plan more systematically.
